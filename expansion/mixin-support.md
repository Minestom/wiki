# Mixin support

## Base set-up for Minestom extensions

In your extension.json file, add this line:

```
  "mixinConfig": "mixins.testextension.json"
```

Replace `mixins.testextension.json` with the name of the JSON configuration file for Mixin.

Example of Mixin configuration for Minestom (`mixins.testextension.json`):

```
{
  "required": true,
  "minVersion": "0.8",
  "package": "testextension.mixins",
  "target": "@env(DEFAULT)",
  "compatibilityLevel": "JAVA_11",
  "mixins": [
    "InstanceContainerMixin",
    "DynamicChunkMixin"
  ]
}
```
